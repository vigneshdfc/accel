      "The hardest part? Starting a company called Remote that was all about remote working – in 2019. The concept was relatively abstract at the time.  Sure, it took off shortly after when the pandemic hit, but in the early days, the problem we were solving felt really niche. It felt like everything was against us – bureaucracy, local governments, and we didn't have a lot of money. But we just kept going. My advice for other founders is that building a company is a marathon in every possible way. You can never sprint to success. It takes a lot of work over a long period of time. Take care of yourself, and work really hard but whether you work 12 hours a day or 15 hours a day probably doesn’t make a huge difference. You have to pace yourself and get rest when you can.",
